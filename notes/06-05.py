three styles of input:

1. tell me up front
2. give me some sort of sentinel at the end
3. expect the read to eventually fail (end-of-file)

three parts to the solution:

1. kernel
2. run harness
3. test harness

kernel can NOT know where input is coming from or where output is going to

Python, JavaScript have "duck" typing

REPL: read, eval, print, loop
